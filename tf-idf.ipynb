    "corpus=[\"\"\"Chef Amanda Cohen always thought she’d use flames to cook. But when she opened her restaurant, Dirt Candy, in a teeny space in Manhattan, there wasn’t a gas line available—so she installed a fleet of induction cooktops instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "They worked so well that “I’ll never go back,” she says. And she didn’t: when Dirt Candy moved to a bigger, gas-enabled location, she still opted for induction cooktops and electric ovens.\n",
    "\n",
    "She’s not alone. Chef Eric Ripert put an induction stove in his own home, as did Alison Roman and Jon Kung, popular chefs on social media. They’re also a staple in professional kitchens, from the Cordon Bleu’s London’s training center to catering kitchens across the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chefs gravitate toward induction’s precision and ease of use, and because the cooktops, whose magnetic fields deliver heat to a pan’s bottom and nowhere else, keep their kitchens much cooler than blasting gas ranges. But there are another pressing reasons people—including a lot of non-chefs—are swapping: to protect both their health and the climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A body of research stretching back to the 1970s has pointed out respiratory hazards linked to indoor pollution from gas stoves. And because gas stovetops are powered by methane, a potent greenhouse gas, reducing its use in homes and commercial spaces would have a small but tangible impact on efforts to trim greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is currently exploring the risks of gas stove emissions in the 38 percent of American households who have one, and looking for ways to minimize indoor air pollution caused by their use. \n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s a triple win,” says Brady Seals: climate, health, and ease of use. Seals led a recent study suggesting over 12 percent of the U.S.’s childhood asthma cases could be associated with breathing in gas stove pollution. About 1 in every 12 Americans has asthma, including five million American children, and its prevalence is increasing.\n",
    "The gas-fired elephant in the room\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas-fired stoves are essentially “little gas-fired power plants in your home,” says Drew Michanowicz, a scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, a public health-focused nonprofit based in California. And since we spend about 90 percent of our time indoors, we can expose ourselves heavily. When gas burns, it releases many lung irritants, like nitrogen dioxide gas (NO2), tiny particles, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 1970s, researchers worldwide had figured out that the inhaled gas penetrates deep into the lungs, driving inflammation. They began to find evidence that long-term exposure to NO2 increased the likelihood of children developing asthma, and that short-term exposure to high concentrations made the condition worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If you have asthma, your airways are already hyper-reactive and hyper-inflamed—and regularly getting that exposure really exacerbates your symptoms,” says Rima Habre, an indoor air quality expert at the University of Southern California.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1971 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enacted its first regulations on outdoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, limiting exposure to 53 parts per billion, averaged over the course of a year. In 2010, the EPA added a new standard: in any given hour, exposure should not top a hundred parts per billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "But NO2 isn’t just an outdoor problem: it can build up indoors, too, but the U.S. and European countries don’t regulate it inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If you cook for an hour on a gas stove, with all your windows closed because it’s cold out, that might increase your 24-hour NO2 exposure by about 25 parts per billion,” says Laura Paulin, a physician and scientist at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine. But in some of the homes she has studied, concentrations have reached over 500 ppb while families cooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is often worse for vulnerable groups, says Patricia Fabian, a public health expert at Boston University, such as renters, people who live in public housing or in environmental justice neighborhoods, or anyone without the resources to update their kitchens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We really worry about gas stoves for people in those situations,” she says. “Opening your window works fine if you’re not next to an [NO2-heavy] highway. These conversations have to take the broader context into account.”\n",
    "We know it hurts kids\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1992 and later a 2013 analysis tied together dozens of studies on gas stoves, indoor air pollution, and respiratory issues. The 2013 study found that that children living in homes with gas stoves had a 32 percent higher risk of having current asthma or developing it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We as experts feel that we’ve known this for years,” says Ulrike Gehring, a public health expert and an author of that 2013 analysis. “In some ways it’s like smoking; we knew that was a risk and paid attention. But gas cooking has never gotten the attention before.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, health researchers have more precisely measured NO2 exposure using personal sensors or constantly monitoring in-home sensors. One study in Baltimore found concentrations peaking into several hundred parts per billion, often associated with cooking; those periods of high exposure correlated with five times more inhaler use later in the day or evening. Studies like those, or another in New York City, help pinpoint the specific impact of gas stoves amidst of soup of other pollutants we breathe in daily, from candles to wood smoke to traffic pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Paulin and her colleagues published a study that swapped out some homes’ old gas stoves for electric, or added an air filter, or added a hood vent. The most effective swap was changing out the stove, decreasing NO2 concentrations by about 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Meyer Kattan, a pediatrics and air quality expert at Columbia University, hammering out precise statistics for how much gas stoves can hurt children or adults’ lungs is beside the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know it hurts kids' lungs, he says. \"How many more studies do we need to tell you that the recommendations are not good enough?” he says.\n",
    "Climate win, too\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas stoves eat up a small percentage of most homes’ natural gas bill. But spread that out to 40 million homes across the U.S. and the annual emissions end up comparable to the greenhouse gas emissions from 500,000 cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You live at the end of the pipeline,” says Michanowicz. “It’s underground, hidden, designed to be out-of-sight, out-of-mind. It’s an incredible physical tether to the fossil fuel system.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Untethering from fossil fuels and electrifying homes and buildings many analyses have shown, is a critical step toward decarbonizing in the U.S. and beyond.\n",
    "What should you do with your gas stove?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have asthma or another respiratory condition, pollutants from your stove are probably not causing you acute harm—especially if you are using it right, says Habre.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means opening windows whenever you cook; putting pots on the back burners and turning an outdoor-venting hood on every single time you light a burner; and avoiding long cooking times on stovetop or in a gas-powered oven.\n",
    "\n",
    "But most of us aren’t using them perfectly, or even close. Tests in California homes showed that even code-compliant fume hoods remove only about half of stove-caused NO2 pollution—and most people don’t turn on their hood every time they use the stove.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who want to make the switch, the options are increasing by the day, and the Inflation Reduction Act includes incentives to help pay for non-gas options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rachelle Boucher, an induction stove expert and former personal chef, has a favorite trick she calls the “pasta water” test: She brings potential buyers into an induction stove showroom and puts a pot of water on to boil.\n",
    "\n",
    "It “happens so fast their eyes turn into saucers,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional chef Jon Kung loves induction, even for super-high-heat wok cooking—a style some feared wouldn’t work without gas. Working in high-end kitchens in China, he saw induction everywhere: it provided “better safety, better comfort, and just a more reliable and cleaner technology,” he says. \n",
    "\n",
    "He just remodeled his home kitchen all-electric. “I love it,” he says.\n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"Fall is a special time of year in the forests along the eastern seaboard, as trees explode in brilliant shades of red and gold. The air is crisp, the days are still warm, and the turning foliage offers an irresistible riot of color—one that, by one rough estimate, generates as much as $30 billion a year in tourism revenue from Maine to the Carolinas.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The mountains here in general are gorgeous,” says Larry Deane, a professional photographer who lives in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains outside Asheville, North Carolina. “You combine that with vivid fall colors and it’s just sort of magical.” \n",
    "\n",
    "But fall is getting warmer as a result of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2014 to 2021, the Northern Hemisphere experienced its eight warmest Octobers on record. And the Northeast, which is most famous for fall foliages, is warming faster than the rest of North America.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Vermont to North Carolina, fall foliage has been appearing behind schedule—continuing a long-term trend that, according to one recent study of maples by researchers at George Mason University, has pushed the appearance of fall colors back more than a month since the 19th century. Temperature is not the only driver; precipitation or the lack of it, extreme weather, and insect infestations also play a role. As climate change affects all those factors, it’s making the timing of peak foliage harder to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s more, climate-related delays in leaf coloration are disrupting annual cycles of growth and rest that trees undergo. What that means for forests—how well trees grow, where they can live, and whether they can keep storing carbon at the same rate—is still unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We ought to be concerned potentially, not just about timing of change for autumn, but whether or not it portends some forest collapse,” says George Mason University ecologist Rebecca Forkner. “While nobody wants to be the ‘sky is falling’ kind of person, we do understand these changes are the plants telling us something is not right.”Why trees need rest\n",
    "\n",
    "Like people, trees must prepare for the cold, dark winter. All spring and summer, their leaves produce a green pigment called chlorophyll that captures sunlight, providing trees the energy to create the sugars and carbohydrates they need to grow and survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "As temperatures drop and days grow shorter, signaling an end to the growing season, trees respond by ending chlorophyll production and absorbing any remaining nutrients—in effect laying down stores for winter. \n",
    "\n",
    "But lurking under that chlorophyll all spring and summer are orange and yellow-hued chemicals, which are unveiled as trees begin to go dormant. In addition, shorter, colder days prompt some tree species, including red and sugar maples, to produce red anthocyanins. Scientists think these red compounds are like a leaf’s winter coat, helping stave off the cold and allowing trees to absorb any last nutrients from the leaves before a cold snap kills the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process leading up to shedding is known as leaf senescence. Climate change is disrupting it in some species more than others, with unknown consequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Plants have this amazing capacity to cope,” says Forkner, but scientists don’t yet know the limits of trees’ ability to adapt. “If they’re not getting their nutrients back, we could see some problems in our forest, but it’s too early to know. We don’t have enough people researching it.” \n",
    "\n",
    "In Maine’s Acadia National Park, scientists have noted a possible link between warm nights in September and delayed fall colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is the biggest signal we have seen,” says Stephanie Spera, an environmental scientist at the University of Richmond who is studying leaf changes in the park. “The whole season is being jeopardized. I think it’s getting a lot shorter. Spring is starting earlier. Everything is shifting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past century, the park has warmed by 3.4°F. Trees and other plant life are feeling this change. One out of every five plant species documented in the park a century ago can no longer be found today.Sorting out the changes in trees\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain historical perspective on changes in fall foliage, Forkner and Alexis Garretson, now a doctoral student at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, turned to herbaria—the plant collections maintained by universities and other institutions. Sifting through digitized records of maple tree leaves collected from the central and eastern U.S. and dating back to the 19th century, they found that the first appearance of fall leaf color had shifted an average of about six hours a year since 1880. Over the course of more than a century, those delays added up to more than a month. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Both of us expected to see a change, and a pretty large one, but both of us were surprised that the signal was so strong,” says Garretson.  \n",
    "The pair also examined the leaves for damage by pathogens or plant-eating animals. They found that the extent of damage has increased over time. It seems to be associated with an increase in summer drought—and also with leaves changing color later but falling off trees earlier: Damaged leaves tended to fall as much as three weeks earlier than undamaged ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With temperatures staying warmer longer, and with spring arriving earlier, trees are experiencing longer growing periods with shorter transition times between warm days and cold frosts. In effect fall is getting shorter. One concern is that trees may not have a chance to finish absorbing the sugars and carbohydrates that remain in their green-tinted leaves before the first winter frost. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The harm could come if you get a sudden freeze. The trees may not be acclimated, and the leaves may fall off before they’ve withdrawn all their nutrients,” warns Howard Neufeld, a biologist at Appalachian State University.\n",
    "\n",
    "That could impact how well a tree grows in the following spring. For a tree, the color change process is “how it goes to the grocery store and gets all the food it needs for next year,” says Forkner. “If it doesn’t do that, there are consequences for the lifespan.” \n",
    "\n",
    "How climate change affects trees, in turn, has a feedback effect on climate. Forests absorb an estimated 30 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions released every year, and if their health wanes, so too might their climate benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "“These ecosystems are buffering us from the worst impacts of climate change,” says Mukund Palat Rao, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who is monitoring the timing of fall leaves to better understand how changes might impact the carbon cycle. “If the ability of forests to do that decreases, then what happens to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Rao says it’s unclear just how much carbon trees can absorb; a longer growing period may not equate to a bigger climate benefit. One recent study of trees in Europe found, as Forkner and Garretson did, that climate change is causing some trees to drop their leaves earlier than they used to. That could reduce the amount of carbon that forests remove from the atmosphere.\"\"\"]"

    "text1=[\"\"\"First came a record-shattering, months-long heat wave, roiling Pakistan from March to May. Just a few weeks later came months of crushing, punishing rains that flooded a third of the entire country. The floods’ economic costs were staggering—about $40 billion, or more than 10 percent of the country’s annual GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these are not “natural” disasters. Just weeks after the catastrophes began in 2022, scientists showed a clear culprit: human-caused climate change, which intensified the rains by up to 75 percent and made the heat wave 30 times more likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Pakistan’s leaders, those findings highlight a long-simmering frustration. “We are responsible for less than one percent of the emissions that lead to climate change,” M. Tariq Irfan, Pakistan’s environment minister, told National Geographic, “yet we are experiencing a multitude of disasters due to it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It is climate injustice, they say—the idea that those least responsible for climate change are bearing the worst burdens. And they’re fed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this year’s U.N. climate conference in Egypt, COP27, Pakistan and a group of other frustrated developing countries are pushing to develop a pool of money for “loss and damages.” It would be a fund, financed by the developed nations most responsible for causing climate change, that would pay for climate-induced losses in countries that have done little to create the problem. The United States alone is responsible for over 20 percent of all historical global emissions of gases that cause climate change, such as carbon dioxide and methane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their case is bolstered by the rise in powerful “attribution” science, a new type of analysis using mostly computer modeling to pinpoint exactly how climate change worsens disasters such as heat waves, super-potent rainstorms, and sea level rise. That extra punch is often what causes the extreme harm to people and ecosystems, says Saleemel Huq, the director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and a long-time climate negotiator for the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "“These are impacts that are happening beyond our capacity for adaptation. We have entered the era of loss and damages,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "To him and many others from developing countries who have seen their calls for climate justice ignored for decades, attribution puts a finer point on the fundamental moral imbalance of cause and effect. “There is no more deniability,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past year, Scotland, Denmark, and a province in Belgium have contributed a few million into a fund in the name of climate justice. And after years of stalling, the U.S. and other developed countries are beginning to tentatively discuss loss and damages. The U.S. is \"committed to engaging constructively,\" says a U.S. State Department representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if there isn’t more explicit discussion of climate justice at this year’s COP27, Huq adds, “we’ll consider the meeting a failure from the start.”\"\"\"]\n",

    "\n",
    "It’s normal for moods to fluctuate with seasons and even for people to feel a little more down in the winter, experts say, but those suffering from SAD experience the symptoms of clinical depression. \n",
    "\n",
    "“They’re exactly the same,” says Kelly Rohan, a psychologist at the University of Vermont who specializes in the disorder. \n",
    "\n",
    "“We would look for things like a persistently sad mood. Losing interest in things. Sleep changes. Significant eating or appetite change. Losing energy. Fatigue. Difficulty concentrating,” she says. \n",
    "\n",
    "At Yale’s Winter Depression Research Clinic, the most commonly reported symptoms of winter depression are hypersomnia—the desire to sleep more than usual—and an increased appetite, says Paul Desan, a psychiatrist and the clinic’s director. \n",

    "Most people begin experiencing symptoms in young adulthood, but SAD can begin at any stage of life. The condition also varies by sex. \n",
    "\n",
    "“About three times as many women as men get SAD for reasons we don’t understand,” says Desan. \n",
    "\n",
    "While SAD is typically diagnosed when patients meet the criteria for clinical depression, some patients fall just short of this official diagnosis. They’re instead diagnosed with “subsyndromal SAD,” a milder but still burdensome condition. \n",
    "Why does SAD happen? \n",

    "“It’s fairly accepted that the trigger is a short photoperiod—the number of hours from dawn to dusk,” says Rohan. “It’s the strongest predictor of when the symptoms begin.” \n",
    "\n",
    "But why, exactly, does less daylight seem to make some people clinically depressed? \n",
    "\n",
    "“That's the million-dollar question,” says Rohan. \n",
    "\n",
    "One leading theory is that the change in daylight disrupts our bodies’ release of melatonin, a hormone the brain releases every night to promote sleep. The process is part of our circadian rhythm, our innate biological clock dictating when we sleep and wake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our clocks are cued up by morning light, but as the supply of daylight dwindles in winter, melatonin may be released later and wear off later, the theory suggests. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means, “that alarm clock might be going off in the morning, but the body is still in a state of biological night,” says Rohan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those diagnosed with SAD may be particularly sensitive to schedules that disrupt their circadian rhythm by beginning and ending at odd hours, like shift work, she adds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even given that theory, she says it’s still unclear why disrupted circadian rhythm can lead to depression, instead of just feeling fatigued. \"\"\"]\n",

    "text3=[\"\"\"Gas-fired stoves are essentially “little gas-fired power plants in your home,” says Drew Michanowicz, a scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, a public health-focused nonprofit based in California. And since we spend about 90 percent of our time indoors, we can expose ourselves heavily. When gas burns, it releases many lung irritants, like nitrogen dioxide gas (NO2), tiny particles, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 1970s, researchers worldwide had figured out that the inhaled gas penetrates deep into the lungs, driving inflammation. They began to find evidence that long-term exposure to NO2 increased the likelihood of children developing asthma, and that short-term exposure to high concentrations made the condition worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If you have asthma, your airways are already hyper-reactive and hyper-inflamed—and regularly getting that exposure really exacerbates your symptoms,” says Rima Habre, an indoor air quality expert at the University of Southern California.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1971 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enacted its first regulations on outdoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, limiting exposure to 53 parts per billion, averaged over the course of a year. In 2010, the EPA added a new standard: in any given hour, exposure should not top a hundred parts per billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "But NO2 isn’t just an outdoor problem: it can build up indoors, too, but the U.S. and European countries don’t regulate it inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If you cook for an hour on a gas stove, with all your windows closed because it’s cold out, that might increase your 24-hour NO2 exposure by about 25 parts per billion,” says Laura Paulin, a physician and scientist at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine. But in some of the homes she has studied, concentrations have reached over 500 ppb while families cooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is often worse for vulnerable groups, says Patricia Fabian, a public health expert at Boston University, such as renters, people who live in public housing or in environmental justice neighborhoods, or anyone without the resources to update their kitchens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We really worry about gas stoves for people in those situations,” she says. “Opening your window works fine if you’re not next to an [NO2-heavy] highway. These conversations have to take the broader context into account.”\n",
    "We know it hurts kids\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1992 and later a 2013 analysis tied together dozens of studies on gas stoves, indoor air pollution, and respiratory issues. The 2013 study found that that children living in homes with gas stoves had a 32 percent higher risk of having current asthma or developing it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We as experts feel that we’ve known this for years,” says Ulrike Gehring, a public health expert and an author of that 2013 analysis. “In some ways it’s like smoking; we knew that was a risk and paid attention. But gas cooking has never gotten the attention before.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, health researchers have more precisely measured NO2 exposure using personal sensors or constantly monitoring in-home sensors. One study in Baltimore found concentrations peaking into several hundred parts per billion, often associated with cooking; those periods of high exposure correlated with five times more inhaler use later in the day or evening. Studies like those, or another in New York City, help pinpoint the specific impact of gas stoves amidst of soup of other pollutants we breathe in daily, from candles to wood smoke to traffic pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Paulin and her colleagues published a study that swapped out some homes’ old gas stoves for electric, or added an air filter, or added a hood vent. The most effective swap was changing out the stove, decreasing NO2 concentrations by about 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Meyer Kattan, a pediatrics and air quality expert at Columbia University, hammering out precise statistics for how much gas stoves can hurt children or adults’ lungs is beside the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know it hurts kids' lungs, he says. \"How many more studies do we need to tell you that the recommendations are not good enough?” he says.\n",
    "Climate win, too\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas stoves eat up a small percentage of most homes’ natural gas bill. But spread that out to 40 million homes across the U.S. and the annual emissions end up comparable to the greenhouse gas emissions from 500,000 cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You live at the end of the pipeline,” says Michanowicz. “It’s underground, hidden, designed to be out-of-sight, out-of-mind. It’s an incredible physical tether to the fossil fuel system.”\n",

    "text4=[\"\"\"What’s more, climate-related delays in leaf coloration are disrupting annual cycles of growth and rest that trees undergo. What that means for forests—how well trees grow, where they can live, and whether they can keep storing carbon at the same rate—is still unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We ought to be concerned potentially, not just about timing of change for autumn, but whether or not it portends some forest collapse,” says George Mason University ecologist Rebecca Forkner. “While nobody wants to be the ‘sky is falling’ kind of person, we do understand these changes are the plants telling us something is not right.”Why trees need rest\n",
    "\n",
    "Like people, trees must prepare for the cold, dark winter. All spring and summer, their leaves produce a green pigment called chlorophyll that captures sunlight, providing trees the energy to create the sugars and carbohydrates they need to grow and survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "As temperatures drop and days grow shorter, signaling an end to the growing season, trees respond by ending chlorophyll production and absorbing any remaining nutrients—in effect laying down stores for winter. \n",
    "\n",
    "But lurking under that chlorophyll all spring and summer are orange and yellow-hued chemicals, which are unveiled as trees begin to go dormant. In addition, shorter, colder days prompt some tree species, including red and sugar maples, to produce red anthocyanins. Scientists think these red compounds are like a leaf’s winter coat, helping stave off the cold and allowing trees to absorb any last nutrients from the leaves before a cold snap kills the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process leading up to shedding is known as leaf senescence. Climate change is disrupting it in some species more than others, with unknown consequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Plants have this amazing capacity to cope,” says Forkner, but scientists don’t yet know the limits of trees’ ability to adapt. “If they’re not getting their nutrients back, we could see some problems in our forest, but it’s too early to know. We don’t have enough people researching it.” \n",
    "\n",
    "In Maine’s Acadia National Park, scientists have noted a possible link between warm nights in September and delayed fall colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is the biggest signal we have seen,” says Stephanie Spera, an environmental scientist at the University of Richmond who is studying leaf changes in the park. “The whole season is being jeopardized. I think it’s getting a lot shorter. Spring is starting earlier. Everything is shifting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past century, the park has warmed by 3.4°F. Trees and other plant life are feeling this change. One out of every five plant species documented in the park a century ago can no longer be found today.Sorting out the changes in trees\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain historical perspective on changes in fall foliage, Forkner and Alexis Garretson, now a doctoral student at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, turned to herbaria—the plant collections maintained by universities and other institutions. Sifting through digitized records of maple tree leaves collected from the central and eastern U.S. and dating back to the 19th century, they found that the first appearance of fall leaf color had shifted an average of about six hours a year since 1880. Over the course of more than a century, those delays added up to more than a month. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Both of us expected to see a change, and a pretty large one, but both of us were surprised that the signal was so strong,” says Garretson.  \n",
    "The pair also examined the leaves for damage by pathogens or plant-eating animals. They found that the extent of damage has increased over time. It seems to be associated with an increase in summer drought—and also with leaves changing color later but falling off trees earlier: Damaged leaves tended to fall as much as three weeks earlier than undamaged ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With temperatures staying warmer longer, and with spring arriving earlier, trees are experiencing longer growing periods with shorter transition times between warm days and cold frosts. In effect fall is getting shorter. One concern is that trees may not have a chance to finish absorbing the sugars and carbohydrates that remain in their green-tinted leaves before the first winter frost. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The harm could come if you get a sudden freeze. The trees may not be acclimated, and the leaves may fall off before they’ve withdrawn all their nutrients,” warns Howard Neufeld, a biologist at Appalachian State University.\n",
    "\n",
    "That could impact how well a tree grows in the following spring. For a tree, the color change process is “how it goes to the grocery store and gets all the food it needs for next year,” says Forkner. “If it doesn’t do that, there are consequences for the lifespan.” \n",
    "\n",
    "How climate change affects trees, in turn, has a feedback effect on climate. Forests absorb an estimated 30 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions released every year, and if their health wanes, so too might their climate benefits. \n",
